# App Native PHP
**I show a basic example of session management in php, applying the model pattern, view, basic controller and its different flows.**

## Local Execution
First you must have the following programs:
  * [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
  * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.htmlhttps://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
---
We download the project with the following command by opening a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/jeirf12/appnativophp
```

Then, we load the `scriptMysql.sql` database script into the `xampp` program.

>* Note: you must have the `xampp` program running, otherwise activate `apache` and `mysql`

To load the script we must type the following in the browser:
```
https://localhost/phpmyadmin
```
Within the administration panel; in the bar at the top, look for the `import` option.

> Then we proceed to upload the script and give it load.

Then we put the project inside the xampp folder at the following address `/xampp/htdocs/`.

> Move the previously downloaded project folder to this path and then open the browser with the following address.
```
https://localhost/{nameFolderOrProject}
```
> * Note: `nameFolderOrProject` goes without brackets. If not, give the folder another name. Then the value of  `nameFoledrOrProject` will be `appnativophp`.
